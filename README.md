# ResVidNet

We've developed ResVidNet, a Convolutional Neural Network inspired by ResNet18, with enhancements, in order to classify multiples ECG Signal :
Normal, Abnormal, History of Myocardial Infarction, Myocardial Infarction and COVID-19.
Thanks to these enhancements, ResVidNet appears to be more robust and accurate than Resnet
